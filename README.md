# ⚡ React to Next.js Code Converter

This project is a utility that helps developers **convert basic React applications into fully structured Next.js projects** with minimal setup.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This tool simplifies the process of migrating from a React app (typically created using Vite) to a Next.js framework by restructuring files, updating configurations, and integrating Next.js routing and architecture.

It’s ideal for:

- Developers transitioning from client-side rendering to server-side rendering or static generation.
- Projects looking to adopt Next.js best practices.
- Quick scaffolding of a Next.js project from existing React code.

---

## 🚧 Limitations (Current)

- ❌ Converted code is **not automatically saved** into the GitHub repository.
- ❌ Converted Next.js code is **not automatically validated** – manual testing is recommended after conversion.

These are known and may be addressed in future updates.
